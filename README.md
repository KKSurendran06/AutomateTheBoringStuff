# AutomateTheBoringStuff

This repository consists of all the answers to practice questions and problems from the book `Automate the Boring Stuff with Python` spanning chapters 1 to 11. I skipped the zombie problem in chapter 6 and the multi-clipboard problem in chapter 9 as I was unable to come up with solutions for those.
