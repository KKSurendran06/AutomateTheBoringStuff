* `<`  - lesser than 

* `>`  - greater than

* `<=` - lesser than or equal to

* `>=` - greater than or equal to

* `=`  - this is responsible for assigning value to a variable

* `==` - this compares L.H.S and R.H.S, and evaluates the expression to a Boolean value

# 7 
a condition is an expression that is evaluated to a Boolean value, it is used at places where where we want to control the flow of program
