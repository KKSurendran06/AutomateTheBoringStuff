# 1
no, it's a third party module

# 2
we can use the module as pyip instead of pyinputplus which saves time

# 3
* `inputInt()` takes integer as input
* `inputFloat()` takes as float as input

# 4
pyip.inputInt(min=0, max=99)

# 5
* `allowRegexes` specifies expression that are allowed
* `blockRegexes` specifies expression that are not allowed

# 6
 if the user enters blank it will display 'blank is not allowed' and limit=3 makes sure that pyInputPlus only prompts the user for input 3 times

 # 7
 the default function makes sure that if nothing is entered as input the default parameter is taken (i.e 'hello')
